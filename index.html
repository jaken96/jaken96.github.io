   Who's woods these are, I think I know,<br>
   his house is in the village though,<br>
   he will not see me stopping here,<br>
   to watch these woods fill up with snow,<br>
   <br>
   my little horse must think it queer,<br>
   to stop without a farmhouse near,<br>
   between the woods and frozen lake,<br>
   the darkest evening of the year,<br>
   <br>
   he gives his harness bells a shake,<br>
   to ask if there is some mistake,<br>
   the only other sound's the sweep,<br>
   of easy wind and downy flake,<br>
   <br>
   These woods are lovely, dark, and deep,<br>
   but I have promises to keep,<br>
   and miles to go before I sleep,<br>
   and miles to go before I sleep.<br>
